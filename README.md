Helper scripts and source files for the workshop given at  Open Source Summit/Embedded Linux Conference 2019 San Diego 
 "Understanding, Building and Researching Minimal (and not so minimal) Linux Systems" by Ron Munitz <ron@thepscg.com> (PSCG Holdings LTD / The PSCG)

The tasks are deliberately divided into very simple scripts, so that 
the student will easily "know what does what" by the script name, without 
needing any special documentation, and without having to really look at the presentations

Before doing anything (in each terminal)
$ . envsetup.sh first
